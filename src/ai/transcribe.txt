### Task

Provide a transcription of the student's handwriting in the following
image, where they answered the math question. Your output should be a mixture
of Markdown and LaTeX. Use Markdown for regular text.

You MUST wrap LaTeX math mode
commands in dollar signs when you want to use them (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}$).

Do NOT change any of the wording in the student answer. Your only job is to
transcribe.
